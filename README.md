# interpreter

A maybe interpreter that maybe works
(Note: right now is only a lexer, parser, and semantic analyzer)

## To Run:
1. Clone with `git clone https://github.com/BenG49/interpreter.git`
2. Run `./gradlew run --args='<file path>'` in the root folder, where `<file path>` is a path pointing to the plaintext file you want to (maybe) interpret
3. Profit
